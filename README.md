# Keylogger

## Abstract

A Keylogger attempts to retrieve confidential information by capturing user input via keystroke monitoring and leaking this information for malicious purposes.

## Aim of the Project

## How Does It Work?

A Keylogger records all information and keeps track of everything typed. This can be used to intercept credit card information, passwords, and other sensitive information typed into the keyboard. Keystroke loggers can be installed as malware without the userâ€™s knowledge in order to steal sensitive data.

3. Run the Keylogger:
